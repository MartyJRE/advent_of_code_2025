# Advent of Code 2025

[![CI](https://github.com/MartyJRE/advent_of_code_2025/actions/workflows/advent.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MartyJRE/advent_of_code_2025/actions/workflows/advent.yml)

Saving Christmas one puzzle at a time. Written in Rust because I hate myself (affectionately).

## The Journey So Far

| Day | Stars | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------|
| [01](src/bin/01.rs) | :star::star: | Spinning in circles |
| [02](src/bin/02.rs) | :star::star: | Pattern-ception |
| [03](src/bin/03.rs) | :star::star: | Generics overkill |
| [04](src/bin/04.rs) | :star::star: | Grid erosion simulator |

**Total: 8/24 stars**

## Running

```bash
cargo run --release --bin 01
```

That's it. That's the whole instruction.
